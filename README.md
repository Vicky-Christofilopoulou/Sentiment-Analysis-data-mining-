# Sentiment-Analysis-data-mining-
This Python project focuses on sentiment analysis and similarity measures for Airbnb reviews, utilizing advanced natural language processing techniques. In the first part, Hugging Face models like BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa are used for sentiment annotation on comments from Airbnb reviews, categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The task involves pre-processing the reviews, annotating them based on sentiment, and comparing the sentiment over time for different years (2019 and 2023), including the comparison across neighborhoods as a bonus.

The second part of the project involves training machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, and KNN) to classify the sentiment of Airbnb reviews. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and various feature extraction techniques, such as TF-IDF and word embeddings, are used to train the models. The evaluation is carried out using 10-fold cross-validation and metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy.

Finally, the project explores similarity measures (Jaccard, Cosine, and others) and semantic neighborhoods. Using word embeddings (such as Word2Vec or GloVe), the similarity between words is calculated, and the semantic neighborhood of two words is analyzed. Different methods to compute the similarity of the neighborhoods are explored, including maximum similarity, correlation of neighborhood similarities, and the sum of squared neighborhood similarities. The project also studies the impact of changing the neighborhood size (parameter N) on these similarity measures and presents examples of word neighborhoods for different N values.
